// BOOL return value indicates whether it should also visit its children; -leaveObject:withVisitedChildren: will be called regardless. This allows memoization and therefore visiting cyclic graphs.
-(BOOL)visitObject:(id)object;
// returned object becomes the result of -acceptVisitor:, and is passed into the parentâ€™s children parameter when it is left. This allows convenient piecewise recursive construction of results given a graph, reusing the call stack instead of having to construct its own stack.

@protocol HammerVisitable <NSObject>

// calls -visitObject:, any children (if -visitObject: returned YES), and then -leaveObject:withVisitedChildren: passing it the results for its children.
// returns the value returned to it by -leaveObject:withVisitedChildren:.
// this method is therefore purely structural, controlling how a visitor walks the receiver and its children.
